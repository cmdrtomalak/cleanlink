A simple program for removal of tracker codes on article and social media URLs being shared.

The twitter_link_cleaner.html can be used just from a browser using client side logic, it can be hosted on any web server path.

It has an additional trick where a query param of https://<webserver>/<cleanerurl/index.html?u=<url to be cleaned> can be directly entered and the browser will try its best to copy the cleaned url onto the OS clipboard.

With x.com it creates two additional frontends that can be helpful when sharing to allow previews of videos and images.

So far only the android client has been tested and requires building APK and installing unsigned.
